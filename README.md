# Recipes_Website

This project allowed me to demonstrate my HTML skills by creating a simple but efficient recipe website. Through this project, I explored various HTML tags and attributes, gaining a deeper understanding of website development. Although the website is straightforward, it served as an excellent learning experience, helping me to refine my HTML abilities.
