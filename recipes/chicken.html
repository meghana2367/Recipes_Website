            <li>1 yellow onion, sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, cut into 1 ½-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into 1 ½-inch pieces</li>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheading">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the spice blend: In a small bowl, combine the paprika, thyme, nutmeg, cardamom, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Set the chicken in a large bowl and pour 
                the spice mix on top. Use your hands to generously coat the chicken with the spices.</li>
            <li>Marinate: In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic and citrus juice. Add the yellow onion 
                to the bowl with the chicken, then pour the lemon juice mixture over top. Add a generous drizzle 
                (about ¼ cup) of extra virgin olive oil. Toss the chicken to ensure it's well-coated. Cover and 
                refrigerate for 2 to4 hourIf you’re short on time, allow the chicken to sit in the marinade for at 
                least 30 minutes at room temperature before grilling.</li>
            <li>Get ready: While the chicken sits in the marinade, make the tahini sauce according to this recipe and store in the 
                fridge until you’re ready to serve. A few minutes before grilling, thread the chicken, bell peppers, and red onion 
                onto skewers (discard the yellow onion, it was just to flavor the chicken). Lightly oil and heat a gas grill or griddle to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Grill: Lightly oil and heat a gas grill or griddle to medium-high heat. Grill the chicken kabobs, turning occasionally 
                until chicken is cooked through (internal temperature should register 165°F), 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve: Place a kabob on a warm pita, and drizzle with tahini sauce.</li>
        </ol>
